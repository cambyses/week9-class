# Time Complexity Cheat Sheet
# ============================================================
#
# 1. The important thing is the *slope* of your algorithm
# 2. Care only about the worst case
#
#
# In order from best to worst:
#
# Notation          Rule of thumb
# ----------        ------------------------------------------
#
# O(1)              Simple expressions
#
# O(log n)          Binary search, "divide-and-conquer", etc.
#
# O(n)              One loop, linear search, etc.
#
# O(n log n)        Most sorting algorithms
#
# O(n^2)            Nested loops
#
# O(2^n)            OMG
